## Decisions Log (newest first)

### [2026-08-05] [HU] manifold joins the crew as agent 10, the Superlearn editor
Context: The operator commissioned manifold: Superlearn (the operator's learning cockpit, a separate app repo) renders editions and a theme map from Supabase but had no editor writing them; the app sat in its seed state. The crew was nine agents, all pure-prompt overlays with no runnable code in this repo.
Decision: manifold lives at agents/manifold/ with the standard OVERLAY.md and IDENTITY.md plus runnable code (editorial pass, outbox router, evals harness), evals-driven from the first output. The Superlearn repo's src/types.ts and src/schemas.ts are the output contract, vendored at a pinned commit; every write must round-trip the app's own reader schemas. A deterministic gate (schema, groundedness, horizon presence, no-shame, Superlearn-never-a-node) blocks any write that fails; failures are logged to reports/manifold/ and never written. Two scheduler triggers ship disabled per house rule. Superlearn is tracked in registry/projects.yaml but takes no portfolio slot (the five slots are full; displacement is the operator's call).
Consequence: The crew is ten; the master brief, overlays, queues/README.md enums, scheduler, and dashboard roster all say so in the same turn. Mission Control now contains agent runtime code, which the README acknowledges. Secrets move formally to the repo-root .env with .env.example as the documented interface. Contract drift against Superlearn becomes a flagged, gated event instead of a silent adaptation.

### [2026-08-05] [AI] manifold's writer schemas are stricter than the app's reader schemas, and both must pass
Context: Superlearn's schemas.ts is reader-side and forgiving by design (.catch() and .default() salvage) so a bad row degrades instead of crashing the app. A writer validating only against those schemas could ship rows that render solely thanks to salvage: silent contract drift.
Decision: manifold validates every row twice: strict writer schemas in agents/manifold/src/contract.ts, then a round-trip through the vendored reader schemas where any salvage rewrite counts as failure.
Consequence: Some rows the app would tolerate are rejected at the gate. That is the point: the reader's forgiveness stays a safety net for the reader, not a loophole for the writer.

### [2026-07-31] [AI] Deck generation added as shared capability; pptx skill installed

Context: Snow requested presentation generation for two distinct audiences: external/professional (investor, portfolio-facing) and internal (documentation, portfolio state summaries). The capability needed to be registered at the crew level rather than siloed into one agent, since both Cardioid and Möbius have standing access to the relevant content and the build paths differ by audience.

Decision: Deck generation is a shared tool routed via Sphere, not per-agent logic. Cardioid handles external decks via Canva MCP (design polish, branded template). Möbius handles internal decks via the pptx skill in Claude Code (speed and clarity). The pptx skill was installed at workspace level from github.com/anthropics/skills (skills/pptx). Both capabilities are on-demand only, no scheduled cadence, and both output through existing HITL approval gates. Cardioid overlay, Möbius overlay, and _master_brief.md updated in the same change.

Consequence: Any agent can request a deck via Sphere. If either use case later needs iteration cycles, multiple variants, or a dedicated review loop, it can graduate to its own agent slot without changes to the shared tool model.

### [2026-07-24] [AI] Dashboard as file viewer, not agent runtime
Context: Phase 2 of ROADMAP.md. The dashboard could either execute agents directly or read their outputs from repo files. Direct execution would couple UI availability to agent execution and add runtime complexity (queues, workers, retry logic) that OpenClaw already provides.
Decision: Dashboard is a read-only viewer over registry, queues, and reports, plus a small append-only write path for operator approvals in decisions.jsonl. Agents run in OpenClaw against the same files. Real-time updates come from SSE + chokidar file watching, not from agent-to-UI messaging.
Consequence: Dashboard can be closed without stopping the crew. Multiple dashboard instances can run against the same repo (though the operator will only run one). If OpenClaw is offline, the dashboard still shows the last known state. Approval writes are observable to agents on their next wake.

### [2026-07-24] [AI] next_gate stays undated at registry time; Möbius reports "not dated" instead of inventing a countdown
Context: Möbius's overlay reports "days to next gate," but milestone text without a date can't be counted down. Adding a target date field would force the operator to guess dates for bets Prism hasn't validated.
Decision: Keep next_gate as free-form milestone text. Update Möbius's overlay to report "gate: <milestone text>, target date: <ISO date if set, else 'not dated'>". No target date is invented at registry time; dates come from Prism memos when a bet is validated, or from the operator explicitly. The operator-provided next_gate values in slots 2 and 3 (2026-07-24) are undated milestone text, consistent with this decision.
Consequence: Möbius weekly sentinel shows undated gates as "not dated" rather than a fake countdown. Torus and Sphere status queries tolerate undated gates without erroring.

### [2026-07-24] [AI] mission-control is tracked in projects.yaml but occupies no portfolio slot
Context: The operator added mission-control (this repo) as a project after confirming all five portfolio slots (see the Slot assignments ADR at the foot of this file, which states the WIP cap is exactly filled and any new entry must displace one of the five). mission-control is infra: it is the cockpit that holds the portfolio and performs the WIP-cap accounting itself. State was derived from the canonical local working tree, not a clone, because the GitHub remote holds only the scaffold commit (d975ab7) and the Phase 1 work is unpushed.
Decision: Add mission-control to registry/projects.yaml as kind: infra, status: active, and deliberately give it no portfolio slot. A portfolio does not occupy one of its own slots; a sixth slot would breach the WIP cap of 5 with nothing displaced.
Consequence: projects.yaml carries seven rows; portfolio.yaml still tracks five slots. Möbius counts mission-control as active infra for archaeology, not against the five WIP slots. If the operator prefers it visible as a slot (by the "infra takes cognitive load" principle applied to slots 4-5), they must displace one of the five; flagged for review, not decided here.

### [2026-07-24] [AI] Watchtower is registered as infra, not personal
Context: Watchtower was empty at the Phase 1 walk; the operator pushed its contents to GitHub later the same day and the row was re-derived from a fresh clone. The repo-only reading is personal: a single-user utility with no commercial layer in v1 by design. But it is tooling that feeds the operator's Claude stack: its PROJECT_OS.md frames it as the source layer for Claude Code Routines, and mission-control's own overlays name Watchtower as the HITL approval surface (agents/helix/OVERLAY.md, agents/sphere/OVERLAY.md). The repo itself names no other operator project.
Decision: kind: infra with an [INFERRED] tag, the personal reading recorded in the row comment, and a conditional rank-5 slot proposal.
Consequence: Watchtower does not touch the commercial cap. If the operator prefers personal, only the label changes; no slot math moves. Superseded if the operator rules otherwise.

### [2026-07-24] [AI] Sienna is registered as infra, not writing
Context: The Phase 1 kind taxonomy fits Sienna two ways: it is a content pipeline (the "writing" definition) and it is tooling other projects depend on (the "infra" definition). The operator's Phase 1 instructions state Sienna is infra and a dependency of the Cardioid agent, and nothing in the Sienna repo contradicts that.
Decision: kind: infra in both registry files, with the alternative reading noted in the row comment. Sienna is proposed for a slot only conditionally.
Consequence: Sienna does not count toward the commercial cap, and Torus and Möbius treat it as tooling. If Sienna ever grows its own commercial line, the kind flips and this entry is superseded.

### [2026-07-24] [AI] TheFrameshift is marked shipped (projects.yaml) and live (portfolio vocabulary)
Context: The strict Phase 1 rule ("shipped" requires every phase done plus a live deployment reference) has no clean match: the board shows every phase shipped except 2C (planned, deliberately held until real production failure modes are observed) and 2D (cancelled), and a live deployment exists: the com.frameshift.bot.plist LaunchAgent runs watcher/bot.py with RunAtLoad and KeepAlive.
Decision: status: shipped with an [INFERRED] tag; live in the portfolio vocabulary. It occupies no slot: live projects do not.
Consequence: The registry reflects the system as deployed and running. If 2C work resumes, status flips to active and this entry is superseded.

### [2026-07-24] [AI] Preflight ranked first in the slot proposal despite the ranking rule's bucket
Context: The Phase 1 ranking rule puts commercial bets in "building or shaping" first. Preflight's derived status is shipping, which the rule does not address, yet it is the bet closest to revenue: pricing set, launch runbook prepared, most recent activity of all walked repos.
Decision: Rank Preflight 1 with an [INFERRED] tag and the reasoning in portfolio.yaml's proposal block. Nothing is hard-assigned; the operator confirms or reorders.
Consequence: The proposal reflects proximity to the $5K MRR goal rather than a literal bucket read. If the operator prefers strict rule order, workoutapp moves to rank 1.

### [2026-07-24] [AI] Phase 1 registry conventions: repo_local extension field, full ISO dates, quoted [GAP] values
Context: The Phase 1 spec asks for the local path AND the remote URL, but the schema has a single repo field; the walked clones were temporary, so local paths could only be name-matched against ~/Projects directory names. Git reports full ISO timestamps (%cI). A bare [GAP] in YAML would parse as a one-element list.
Decision: repo holds the git remote URL; a repo_local extension field holds the operator's local checkout path, tagged [INFERRED] or [GAP]. started and last_activity store full ISO commit timestamps. Every [GAP] value is a quoted string. Proposed portfolio rows also carry a slug field matching projects.yaml so slot entries and project rows join cleanly.
Consequence: The schema gains two fields (repo_local, slug) that consumers must tolerate. Timestamps are more precise than the schema examples show. Grepping for [GAP] and [INFERRED] still works.

### [2026-07-23] [AI] Queue files ship truly empty; line schemas live in queues/README.md
Context: The queues need documented line formats, but comments are not valid JSONL, so a leading comment line would break every parser.
Decision: queues/decisions.jsonl and queues/handoffs.jsonl are zero-byte files. The JSON schema of each future line is documented in queues/README.md.
Consequence: Parsers consume the .jsonl files with no special-casing. Anyone appending a line must read queues/README.md first, and schema drift between the README and real lines is a bug to watch for.

### [2026-07-23] [AI] All scheduler triggers ship disabled
Context: The scaffold session must produce the substrate without starting any automated agent runs; the operator has not yet reviewed the crew.
Decision: Every trigger in schedule/scheduler.yaml carries enabled: false. The operator flips enabled: true per trigger when ready.
Consequence: Nothing runs unprompted after this commit. The cost is one manual edit per trigger before the crew comes alive.

### [2026-07-23] [AI] DECISIONS.md is a separate file, not a section of PROJECT_OS.md
Context: The house project-os skill defaults to a Decisions Log section inside PROJECT_OS.md, but the master brief defines ProjectOS as five files including a standalone DECISIONS.md (agents/_master_brief.md).
Decision: The ADR log lives here. PROJECT_OS.md keeps a Decisions Log section that points to this file.
Consequence: PROJECT_OS.md stays calm and rarely changes. Readers follow one pointer to reach the full ADRs.

### [2026-07-23] [HU] AGENTS.md is canonical; CLAUDE.md is a symlink
Context: The rules file must stay portable across agent tools (Claude Code today, others later) without maintaining the same rules twice.
Decision: AGENTS.md is the canonical rules file. CLAUDE.md is a symlink created with ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md.
Consequence: One file to maintain. Any tool that does not follow symlinks needs a copy, which would reintroduce the duplication this avoids.

### [2026-07-23] [HU] Agents are named as shapes
Context: Nine agents need stable, memorable names that survive role tweaks and carry no misleading semantics.
Decision: Geometric names: Sphere, Torus, Prism, Icosa, Helix, Klein, Cardioid, Möbius, Parabola.
Consequence: Names never need renaming when roles evolve, but a name alone tells you nothing: roles must be read from agents/<shape>/OVERLAY.md.

### [2026-07-23] [HU] Agent overlays are versioned in this repo
Context: Agent behavior is a portfolio-level asset. Behavior changes must be auditable, diffable, and revertible, not edited live in a runtime store.
Decision: Each agent's behavior contract lives in agents/<shape>/OVERLAY.md under git.
Consequence: Every behavior change leaves history and can be reviewed or rolled back. Changing an agent requires a commit, which is friction by design.

### [2026-07-23] [HU] The registry lives in this repo, not in Notion
Context: Portfolio state needs exactly one canonical home. Notion is convenient for cross-machine visibility but is not git-versioned, diffable, or agent-native.
Decision: registry/portfolio.yaml and registry/projects.yaml in this repo are canonical for portfolio state. Notion is a mirror written by Möbius in Phase 3 (ROADMAP.md).
Consequence: State changes are versioned and reviewable. The Notion mirror can lag or drift; flagging that drift is Möbius's job, not a canonicity question.

## ADR: Slot assignments and MRR target split

**Context.** Phase 1 populated the registry with 5 candidates from 6
walked repos. Operator confirmed all 5 as slot occupants, including
2 infra projects, on the principle that infra takes real cognitive
load and should be visible against the WIP cap.

**Decision.**
- Slots 1-3: the three commercial bets, with mrr_target_usd split
  2500/1500/1000 (weighted by conviction).
- Slots 4-5: infra (Watchtower, Sienna), mrr_target null.
- All notion_page fields marked [GAP], to be populated by Möbius in
  Phase 3.
- Not-on-list directories from ~/Projects (novacrm, eggcrm, pinai,
  gateway, zen) are treated as non-active and excluded from
  projects.yaml.

**Consequence.** WIP cap is exactly filled. Any new bet must displace
one of the five. Möbius weekly sentinel will run against the full
five and produce the first real report.
